## Projects

**Quadrotor Sliding Mode Control** | *Dec. 2022*  
- Designed a sliding mode controller for a quadrotor to track a trajectory.
- Derived the control laws in MATLAB and simulated the quadrotor using the Crazyflie ROS package in Gazebo.
- Successfully tracked the trajectory within a 5 cm error threshold and specified torque limits.

**Inverse Dynamics Control of UR5** | *Apr. 2023*  
- Achieved trajectory tracking of a UR5 robot (6-DOF) by implementing inverse dynamics control in MATLAB.
- Computed kinematics - forward through the product of exponentials and inverse using damped least squares.
- Applied the Recursive Newton-Euler algorithm to obtain torques and simulate the dynamics of the robot.

**Agent Motion-Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles** | *Mar. â€“ Apr. 2023*  
- Developed a motion-prediction model to predict future agent (vehicle) trajectories using birds-eye-view images.
- Designed and implemented a novel architecture combining ResNet50 with a sequence-to-sequence-based model.
- Trained the model on Woven Planetsâ€™ motion-prediction dataset achieving a test MSE loss of 60.39.

**Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF)** | *Mar. â€“ Apr. 2023*  
- Implemented CBS & CBSH-CR algorithms to compute optimal collision-free paths for multiple agents in 2-D grid.
- Achieved a success rate of 80% with CBSH-CR and 60% with CBS across various test cases.
- Realized improved efficiency with CBSH-CR being 66% faster than CBS (on average).

**Campus Navigator** | *Feb. â€“ Mar. 2023*  
- Applied various sampling-based motion planning algorithms to navigate WPIâ€™s campus map.
- Programmed PRM, RRT-based algorithms for path planning including RRT* and Informed-RRT*.
- Assessed the efficacy of different algorithms by comparing path lengths for different queries.
